# ImmoEliza: Data Analysis

## Description
**This repository is contains Data Analysis for a fictional real estate company called "ImmoEliza". I created it as part of my [BeCode](https://www.becode.org) AI Bootcamp training in 2023.**

The data used in this project was sourced from the repository [ImmoEliza: Collecting Data](https://github.com/DeFre/ImmoEliza-collecting-data) which was used to collect data on 10.000 properties from Immoweb.

## Installation
Clone the repo. It can than be opened using a program such a VS code or import it in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) if you prefer to run it in browser.

The following Python libraries need to be installed to use the notebook:
* Numpy
* Re (Regex)
* Matplotlib.pyplot
* seaborn
* Pandas
* Time

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook called data-analysis.ipynb.
Without modifcation, the code will import scraped_data_10.csv as a dataframe.
When you "Run All", all code blocks will run in sequence and create the visuals which can be found in the section Graphs of the notebook.

## Timeline
This project was created between 05/07/2023 and 11/07/2023 in a 5-day in-class coding challenge. 

## Contributors
